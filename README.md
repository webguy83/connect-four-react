## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [MUI](https://mui.com/) - React UI framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Where do I begin? Learned a ton about using custom hooks in React and utilizing several useful components in MUI in regards to the Sliding animations and custom buttons, etc. Also learned a ton of logical problem solving which was the biggest aspect of completing this challenge especially when making the CPU ai and having it be somewhat intelligent.

### Continued development

Definitely will look at building new games that have similiar complex logic. This was fun to build!

### Useful resources

- [Approach to building Connect Four](https://parzibyte.me/blog/en/2020/08/24/connect-4-javascript-html/) - This helped to sort of get an idea of one such approach however I didn't use any of the code and this was done in VueJS while I used React.
- [Approach for making CPU](https://parzibyte.me/blog/2020/07/11/algoritmo-simple-ganar-conecta-4/) - Be sure to translate this page to English via the Google Translate. After the translate this helped me get an idea to an approach for the CPU AI. I went the extra mile and fixed the failures this approach had by checking the for the next move.
